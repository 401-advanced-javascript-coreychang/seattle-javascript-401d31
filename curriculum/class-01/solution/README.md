====================================================================

* This lab requires the students to:
  * Write tests for the arithmetic module (provided for them)
  * Extend the arithmetic module (multiply/divide)
  * Refactor it to move the argument type checking and counts into a shared function
  * Write a similar "greet" module from scratch.
* The package.json purposefully does not have dependencies or scripts in it
  * They will have to install jest, eslint and the appropriate scripts
* To turn this in, they must:
  * Fork the repo
  * Submit a PR against their master branch
  * Submit a link to Travis-ci.com showing their passing tests
