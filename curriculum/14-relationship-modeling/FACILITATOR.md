# Class 14

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about creating "relationships" in MongoDB.  Be sure to have a good grasp on how to use the MongooseJS method `populate` for query population at the database level.  Students will need to understand how `ObjectId`'s are used to create pointers to other resources.  Relating this to SQL based DBMS's and how tables can contains primary/foriegn keys to create relationships may be a good idea.  That said, be sure to discuss the differences, pros, and cons of using a SQL based VS noSQL based DBMS.

## What changed from yesterday? 
Time to connect our resources!  Students have been working with a single resource API up until this point.  Today, that changes.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with the configuration and use of `populate`.  Be sure to demostrate how this works, along with potentially looking at created collections in the MongoDB shell and how the `ObjectId`'s for associated resources look at this level.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Lots of bugs and lot's of issues connection resources, specifically through the use of `populate`.  Lecture on this topic as much as you can!
