# Class 06

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about OSI model and working within a TCP layer.  You'll want to be comfortable with the native NodeJS `net` module, in order to create a TCP chat server for the daily lecture demo.  You can find several implemetations of this demo in the */demos* directory.
 
## What changed from yesterday?
Students were working with basic NodeJS concepts, async programming, binary data, and general file system I/O during the past week.  This week is all about how the internet works, starting with the build of a TCP application, then moving into HTTP based applications for the remainder of the course.  You'll want to discuss how HTTP is built on top of TCP and what processes take place to get data from one communication endpoint to the other.

## What might students struggle with today?
Students will struggle with getting their applications to run, along with remembering the commands to start, connect, and use the application.  Be sure to discuss the use of `telnet` to connect to their application, including random helper commands - like how to disconnect on the client side.  Students on Windows machines may have issues with carriage/line returns in their command strings so it's a good idea to bring this up early on, to avoid any confusion during lab.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
As pointed out above - lots of little issues will crop up when creating their lab assignment.  Most of these issues are configuration based.

## General comments
This is a fun day for students - get them excited about TCP servers and set their expectations that they'll be working exclusively with HTTP after this lecture/lab.
