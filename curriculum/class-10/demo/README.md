# Demos: Block 2 DSA & Design

### Bitmaps  [`demo/bitmap-demo.js`]

[Common Curriculum Stacks & Queues Demo](http://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curricussssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssslum/design-assignments/)

Don't go much deeper than the core implementation of a list constructor.

* Head
* Tail
* While Loop to go through and add a node to the end - O(n)
* Simple head replacement to put a new node at the start - O(1)

### SASS
[Sassmeister](http://www.sassmeister.com)

Use the Sassmeister online tool (which was built by a former Code Fellows student) to do your initial demo into SASS, hitting on the following basic points:

* Nested Selectors
* Use of the `&` to stick rules
* Variables
* Mixins
* Loading of Partials

The demo code included in this repo, when typed in, will showcase in real time how SASS compiles down to CSS.

Do the mixins last, once the students grok the idea of nesting and variables.
