============================================================================================

## Lab Requirements

### Object Manipulation
* Implement Car and Motorcycle using a `factory` and a `class`, based on the `constructor`
* Add support for the new implementations to the test
* Imperative that they do not change the actual tests (these assert that the implementations share the correct interface)
      
#### Grading Standards & Notes
  * Features
  * Code Quality
  * Testing
  * Deployment
    * Travis Only
  * Documentation
    * README Standards 
    * JSDoc Required
    
#### Lab Assistance Notes
* They will feel like this is a copy/paste exercise, but encourage to reference their previous iteration and continutally re-implement, from different starting points.
* Hammer in the point of never changing the tests, only the implementation
* There's no package.json provided, and the tests/index don't require all of the files in.
* They'll need to figure out how to wire all of that in.
* Show them how the tests are running in a loop, that may confuse them.


### List Constructor
* .length property
* `push()`
* `pop()`
* `shift()`
* `unshift()`
* `forEach()`

**Stretch Goals**: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `splice()`, `reverse()`

#### Tests
* This is a class so they'll need to instantiate it to test it
* Dataset should be built up and manipulated as they run through te tests.
* Verify length changing as they add/remove
* Can you foreach/map/etc with only one?
