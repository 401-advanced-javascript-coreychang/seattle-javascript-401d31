============================================================================================

## Lab Prep
* The first part of this lab requires the students implement and re-implement inherited objects and copy the logic between constructors, factories, and classes
* They will feel like this is a copy/paste exercise, but encourage to reference their previous iteration and continutally re-implement, from different starting points.
* Hammer in the point of never changing the tests, only the implementation
* In the starter code, you'll see that the exports line doesn't export everything, and it also doesn't necessarily export what the tests/front-end are expecting. This is by design. Students should be challenged to figure out why things "aren't defined" yet appear to be.
* For the list constructor, `map(), filter(), reduce()` are there as stretch goals. Students will likely not get to these, so prepare to show those in code review in class 3
