# Facilitators Guide: Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming

## Learning Objectives
**Students will be able to ...**

* create npm scripts for automating command line tasks
* nd function context with `call`, `apply`, and `bind`
* handle thrown errors through the use of `try` and `catch`
* interpret the different types of errors in Javascript
* describe the difference between a constructor function and a factory function
* identify and explain the qualities of imperative and functional code
* implement a functional, array-like, list with `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach` methods


## Preparation
* Have a solid grasp on scope and context. We're not going too deep into `call`, `apply`, `bind`, but having a good grasp on these topics will allow for a smooth demo of how you can pass `this` around.
* Understand how to throw and trap errors and exceptions.
* Practice creating instances with Constructor functions, Classes, and Factories. A big part of today is going to be having students really dig in and get deep with these

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow
* Error Handling
  * Why, How
  * Error Module
* Context
  * Revisit `this`
  * Passing context around is sometimes required
    * Demonstrate areas where `call()`, `apply()`, `bind()` fill gaps
* Functional Programming
  * Single Responsibility
  * Immutability
  * Purity (!Side Effects)
* Classes and Factory Functions
  * Similarities & Differences between these and constructor functions
  * Use Cases for each
  * Demo: Animal/Dog
* Big Demo -- The List Constructor


## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
* Students will struggle bigtime with `call`, `apply`, and `bind` and when, where, why to use them. The demo code is setup specifically to showcase a few common use cases.
  * Show them, explain them briefly and move on ... tell your students to bookmark this becuase in 2 years they're going to know they need it and will forget where they heard about it ...

## General Comments and Notes
* There is a LOT to get through today, which is mostly conceptual.
