# Facilitators Guide: React Native Deployments

## Learning Objectives

**Students will be able to ...**

* Implement Device Features
* Apply Styling
* (optionally) Deploy a React Native app to the Google Play or Apple App Store(s)

## Preparation
* Get an app deployed through expo to both app stores so you know the process!

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow
* Demonstrate the developer interfaces to the App store and Google Play
  * Talk through the processes to get apps deployed by yourself.
  * How does expo help?
  * What do most companies do?
  * Can AWS or Azure play a role?
* Demonstrate the process of getting your app in the stores and at AWS
* Demonstrate "eject" and how that impacts your ability to deploy, and also opens the door to both chaos and power.

## Lab Prep / Solution
* The students are to be finishing out their phone apps today and (optionally) getting them deployed. Deployment is a complete stretch goal. Exposure to it is the key, but we want the students to focus on the building and creativity process.
* Their focus for this lab will be in styling, usability and overall fidelity
