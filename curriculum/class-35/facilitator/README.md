# Facilitators Guide: Block 7 - DS&A, Designs, Comp Sci, Recap


At the end of this Block the students are presented with 3 assignments:

* End of Block "Project": RESTy Refactor (to Context/Hooks)
  * 25 Points
  * Paired
  * Due prior to the start of the next Block
* Design Challenge: Grid Layouts
  * 10 Points
  * Due prior to the end of the next Block
* Data Structure Implementation: Graphs
  * 10 Points
  * Due prior to the start of the next class
    * Will be used in subsequent code challenges
    

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

### DS&A - Graphs

* We've been using Graphs the whole time
  * Linked Lists, Binary Trees, BSTs are all types of graphs
  * Graphs are all about relationships
  * The structures we've encountered so far have rules that govern those relationships
  * Graphs have fewer rules, and many more connections
* Types of graphs
  * Cyclic
  * Acyclic
* Parts of graphs
  * Edges
  * Vertices
  * Neighbors
* Traversing Graphs
  * Breadth First

Lots of opportunities for pictures and live examples of graphs in the real world.

  * The internet itself
  * Our brains
  * Roadways (maps)


### SASS - Grids

* Not talking about CSS Grid (although you can use it!)
* Page layouts using traditional grid systems which describe columnar layouts, breaking pages down into `x` columns for layout options
* Content spans 1 or more columns
* Columns can optionally span 1 or more rows
* Can be implemented using `float`, `flex` or more easily with `grid` display types


For demo, review the starter code (in the design-assignments folder) and look at the table markup for both normal and responsive tables

### Lab Prep

* Demo the currently [deployed RESTy app](https://resty.netlify.com)
* Whiteboard and plan out how to approach the architecture given knowledge of Context and  Hooks being layered onto their core React knowledge
