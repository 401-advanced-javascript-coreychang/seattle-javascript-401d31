# Facilitators Guide: CMS Project


## Lab Prep

There are 2 lab options for this assignment. Assign them the lab most appropriate for their level and understanding.


### Bug Fix

This CMS is implemented, but with bugs. This should be assigned to cohorts who are struggling with wiring of a React/Redux application. This will force them to visit and fix nearly every file in the codebase and create a working app.  The students will need to:

* Fix the bugs
* Fully implement the requirements
* Write a full set of documentation
* Write a full suite of tests
* Deploy


### Build the CMS

For this lab, students will be tasked with building the full CMS without a starter set of code. This is targeted for Cohorts with a higher aptitude and execution level.
