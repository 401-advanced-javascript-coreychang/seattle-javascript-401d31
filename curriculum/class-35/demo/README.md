# Demos: Block 7 - DS&A, Designs, Comp Sci, Recap 

### Graphs

[Common Curriculum Graph Demo](https://github.com/codefellows/common_curriculum/tree/master/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/demos/javascript)

* The demo goes pretty far into the implementation
* Depending on how your class is receiving the information, stay shallow with the code or go deeper if they need more live examples.
* Lab will have them doing an implementation and multiple traversals in subsequent code challenges.
* It's more important that you spend time in demo on the drawings and how your visual pathways map to the code that goes through it.

### SASS: Grids

Use the included sample, which uses an off-the-shelf grid to do a simple layout. 

Demo here should be less about the CSS code itself but rather in how grids actually work, so that they can replicate that during the following days -- their lab is going to be to implement their own custom grid system, using this as inspiration.

It has been helpful in the past to talk about, with drawings, how these can work and then pair program part of the implementation with either a TA or a student, getting input from the class

Generally speaking, the SASS demos are great when interactively, as most students have a decent understanding of CSS and are much more willing to contribute ideas.


### Project / Lab Prep

Students will be creating a complete version of the [RESTy](https://resty.netlify.com) application by refactoring a simplistic working version.

* Do not do a code review of their starter code.
* It's important for this lab that they're able to jump into existing code and "figure it out", especially when given a visually working application to build from.
* Ensure that you have a running API server
* Recommend that the students use their own
* They should be able to run their RESTy against any API
