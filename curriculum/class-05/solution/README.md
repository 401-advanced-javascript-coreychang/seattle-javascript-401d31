# Solution: Bitmap Transformer

## Lab Requirements
Perform 2+ Transformations on an 8-bit bitmap file

#### Grading Standards & Notes
  * Features
    * 2 Transformations
    * Not "turn it blue" and "turn it red"
    * One basic color transform is cool
  * Code Quality
    * Each transform should be in it's own module
    * Dynamically load/run the transform based on input
    * Parse the bitmap with a constructor or class
    * File ops should be separate, reusable modules
    * Promises!
  * Testing
    * Test everything independently
    * Transforms should potentially work on any buffer
    * Mock out an 8-bit buffer that you can predicably test
  * Deployment
    * Travis Only
  * Documentation
    * README Standards
    * JSDoc Required
    * Documentation should be VERY clear about how to run the transformations in the terminal
      * Getting good habits for documenting terminal commands is important for students, so be strict about this
      * Enforcing clear documentation now will make or better documentation and easier grading later on



#### Lab Assistance Notes
* Don't hand hold them
* RTFM. RTFM. RTFM.
