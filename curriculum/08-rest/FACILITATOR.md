# Class 08

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about the REST architectural style and the build out of a vanilla RESTful API.  This API was designed to be as "vanilla" as possible, to demonstrate the concepts of many of the 3rd party modules and packages that they'll be using in the coming weeks.

The lecture for this day requires **lots and lots** of code. Be sure to build out a demo beforehand (or review the ones in this directory) to help you get started and figure out proper pacing. Students will need to review your lecture videos for this day rather heavily - be sure to screen capture the entire build.
 
## What changed from yesterday?
No more experimentation with the request/response cycle.  It's time to build something real.

## What might students struggle with today?
Students will struggle with getting all of these pieces of their API put together.  There's lot's of modularization taking place on this day - structring your demos to be built from a non-linear and pragmatic/practical approach will help them when they are studying on their own.  It will also aid in pushing students to not just re-type the lecture demo in a linear fashion but to think about when/how each module was built and when/how it should be integrated.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Lot's of failing tests!  Have your TAs prepped and ready to tackle this.
