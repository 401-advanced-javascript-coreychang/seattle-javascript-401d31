[Dynamic Forms Solution](https://codesandbox.io/s/3x4llr063q)

## Lab Prep
* Students will implementing PUT, GET, PATCH in the redux starter app. DELETE has been done for them.  What they'll need to get to is how to pass a record ID down to the <Record> component and then how to manipulate state in the reducer. They'll need to dive into spread, deconstruction, and all of those functional methods.
* We'll also be hooking into an API server. Grading that could be tough if they set up their react apps to use a local server. There's a remote API deployed that you can hook into, by changing their API url: https://javascript-401-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/
* Definitely looking for them to do a full integration with the API for all methods.
* Sticking points for them will be in getting the reducers right and handling multiple reducers
* Basic tests using a store will be required, but not full coverage. There's a lot of other work to complete, but getting the core Redux test wiring in place is a baseline goal for today.
