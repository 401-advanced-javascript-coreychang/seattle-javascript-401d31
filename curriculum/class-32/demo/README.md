===========================================================

### [JSON Schema Form](https://codesandbox.io/s/l988k9x8n9)
* Use a static .json file (include it) instead of pulling from an API server. If you have time, you can demonstrate that, but the priority here is not how we get the schema, but that we have it and that we can use it.
* Create a form with it, and implement all of the REST verbs with actions and reducers to show that you can fully CRUD a model (although virtually).  We will be doing this with a real API in the next class.

### [Redux Form](https://codesandbox.io/s/0q6wq20p20)
* Reference the schema model, but you can't use it here. You'll need to build out the form with `<Field />` components as specified in the Redux Form docs.
* But you can still grab the form contents and touch your state, which is the whole purpose.
