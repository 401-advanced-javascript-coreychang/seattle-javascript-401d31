# Class 02

## How do I prep for today?
Have a solid understanding scope and context.  You'll want to detail those topics as much as you can, which should set you up for an easy transition into `call`, `apply`, and `bind`.  Build a few demos for yourself and take a look at demos from previous cohorts (in the **demos** directory of each day) to get an idea of the what to talk about and how.
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
This day requires an hour or so of discussing basic NodeJS tooling. You'll be adding a `package.json`, `.gitignore`, and custom `npm` scripts for testing and linting. If you used `jest` to introduce testing on day 1, you'll now be able to dive into the intricacies of what a `package.json` is, what it's used for, and how to create it (automate with `npm init -y`).

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with the difference between `call` and `apply`.  Seperate demos, with seperate problem domains, will help solidify the usage of these methods.  Be sure to showcase the documentation for them on MDN and assist students in understanding how to properly read and digest the associated documentation.

Students will likely still be struggling with basic testing constructs.  During code review, you'll want to get an idea of how students did with the testing of their previous lab assignment.  This will allow you to gain insight on you individual and common class-wide issues. You can address these directly during code review and/or as you build out the testing portion of your demo later in the lecture.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Talk about use cases for `call` and `apply` and push students to do their own independent exploration of context.  This will not only help them in lab but will assist them in knowing the "when", "why", and "how" during the development of future projects.

## General comments
Have fun! Provide students with some insight on what's to come the following day/week (get them excited about file system I/O)!
