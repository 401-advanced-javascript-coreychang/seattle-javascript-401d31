# 401 Advanced Javascript - Daily Warm-Up Exercises

With the exception of Week 1 and Week 9 (the first and last weeks of the course), students will be expected to complete a daily "Warm-Up" exercise.

The intent is to build muscle memory on some the core fundamentals of the language and as a JS developer in general. As such, these 4 warm-ups repeat each week, so students will complete each of them 6 times throughout the course, and the daily warm-up 24 times.

## [Daily Warmup](../warmup-daily/README)
* Work with arrays, functions, looping, and objects.  Implement spread, deconstruction techniques along with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## First-half Warmups

### [The Holy Grail](../warmup-01/README)
* Implement the "Holy Grail" web layout using Float, Flexbox, and Grid, adding some "flavor" on each subsequent iteration.

### [Async](../warmup-04/README)
* One of the biggest strengths of Javascript is its use of and prowesss at asynchronous actions. At the core of this is Promises and async/await.
* This challenge will have students using Promises and Async to fetch and transform remote dataâ€”actions which are done daily in production level work.

## Second-half Warmups

### [Express Server](../warmup-02/README)
* A qualified JS developer should be able to produce an express server "on demand". This warm-up will have students creating a basic Expresss server, using TDD which utilizes the core Express components (`get`, `post`, EJS, middleware).

### [Data Structures](../warmup-03/README)
* Every data structure has at its base, a means of traversal. Every data structure challenge/question/interview has at its base a requirement that you "do something" while traversing.
* This warm-up exercise is intended to make the traversals trivial so that students can focus solely on the logic that occurs during traversals to solve challenges.
