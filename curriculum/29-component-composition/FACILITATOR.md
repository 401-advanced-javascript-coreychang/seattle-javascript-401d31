# Class 29

## How do I prep for today?
Today is an extension of yesterday and will likely require light layers of refactoring within your lecture demo.  Be sure to have a previously built/refactored version to help you prepare.  If you plan on referencing the demos from prior courses, running a `diff` on the previous day's demo and the current one should clearly showcase the changes.

## What changed from yesterday? 
More components and more nesting of components!

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will continue to struggle with state management and how to properly nest components.  Be ready to address these issues during lecture *and* lab.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Students will often have issues with handling the state of their application.  Many times, this is related to them attempting to directly manipulate the state as opposed to creating a new state.  Again, discuss state management as much as you deem fit.
