=======================================================================================
This is the second of a 2-day grouped research and development project, designed to have the students teach themselves an entirely new framework, and then prepare a knowledge transfer of their learnings to the group.

## Preparation
* Dust off your wordpress and FTP chops. This is the day we show them how to make some $$ on the side ...

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow
* Cement the process and expectations
  * Do a quick code-review of your counter implementation
  * Walk through the completed README, demonstrating the type of documentation that we expect them to produce
* Break
* Perform your own "Knowledge Transfer" presentation. This should be a live demo of what you expect from them.
* Do some Q&A to make sure that they understand the expectation for this project and are not blocked.
* Break
* Wordpress!
  * Download it
  * Install it
  * Start up a blog
  * Walk through where themes are and how they operate
  * Install a few plugins so that they can see how easy it is to add functionality.
* Why Wordpress?
  * There's a really high chance that they'll see this in the wild
    * Their company site may run on it
    * They might end up in an agency
    * Sidework is out there
      * Show creative circle and craigslist ads
