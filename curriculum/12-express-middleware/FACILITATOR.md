# Class 12

## How do I prep for today?
This day is all about middleware.  You'll want to have a good grasp on the differences between route, application, custom and 3rd party middleware.  A detailed explanation of how middleware can manipulate parts of the request/response is key to setting students up for using middleware effectively during their lab.

## What changed from yesterday?
The same concepts presented yesterday will be used today.  The only major difference is the inclusion of additional 3rd party middleware, and the creation of a custom error-handling middleware module, that can be used at the application level.  Feel free to review the demo's for today gain a better understanding of how this should be presented.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with the "why" behind route level and application level middleware.  They'll also struggle with understanding the handling of errors within the custom error-handling middleware module that you create.  Spend as much time recapping the creation of this file as you deem fit.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Understanding how errors get handled within the error-handling middleware module often causes confusion.  Get as detailed as you need to be during this piece of lecture, it really helps as students start to handle more verbose errors in the coming days.
