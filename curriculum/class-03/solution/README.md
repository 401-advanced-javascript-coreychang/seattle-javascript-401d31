# Solution: Async

## Lab Requirements

* Use the fs module to read a file, change its contents, and save it out
  * This will be a "start from scratch" assignment
      
#### Grading Standards & Notes
  * Features
    * Must read from CLI
    * Must write back to the file something different
    * Must process the object as JSON in and out of the file
      * This should be done in the modules, not the implementation
  * Code Quality
  * Testing
    * Must use the mocked fs to test this
    * Modules should be tested fully.
    * The front-end app (index.js) need not be tested
  * Deployment
    * Travis Only
  * Documentation
    * README Standards 
    * JSDoc Required
    
#### Lab Assistance Notes
* They will need help understanding process.argv and reading in options from the command line. Drive them to the docs, and help them verbalize what they'll want to be searching for.
* This will be their first time dealing with a mock.
