# LAB: Deployment

### Get this code up and running Travis and Heroku!

#### Getting Started
Refer to *Getting Started* in [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for complete setup instructions

## Requirements

- Create a branch rule disallowing merges to master unless Travis builds are green

- Connect Travis to your git account
  - Check that travis finds this newly created repo

- Connect your Heroku to your git repo
  - Set heroku to auto deploy from master (or any named branch)
  - Optional: set heroku to require CI (this will cause Heroku to deploy with and only with passing travis build)

## Testing
* tests in starter code pass in travis

### Assignment Submission Instructions
Refer to the [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for the complete lab submission process and expectations
