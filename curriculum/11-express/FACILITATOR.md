# Class 11

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about using tools for the creation of an API as opposed to the vanilla implementations that we used the prior week.  Students should have a decent handle on how the ExpressJS router works at this point as they've already built a vanilla version.  It's a good idea to recap the custom router they created, along with the WRRC (web request response cycle) to ensure that they have a solid understanding of how an API, and it's associated endpoints, are created and used.
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
The previous week was primarily about the creation of an HTTP server and API, without the use of a database and 3rd party npm modules or tools.  This week, that changes and their applications should start to take the shape of a "modern" RESTful API that includes modern tools and a real database persistence layer.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students from prior 301 courses shouldn't struggle too much during this day.  They've had some experience with creating an Express based API already and should feel like this day is primarily a recap of those concepts.  Test-in students will likely need some additional help during lab, primarily with just understanding the basics of ExpressJS.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
No real major issues are normally present during the course of this day - students tend to enjoy the experimentation phase during lab and get really excited about the use of tools, instead of using entirely vanilla NodeJS modules for development.
