![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) SOLUTION - Application State
==================================================================

[solution: reducers](https://codesandbox.io/s/nr4j6jzmn4)

[solution: connect](https://codesandbox.io/s/0pk8q41mq0)


## Lab Prep
Students will be working with 2 bits of starter code. In both cases, the store is provided.

* Task 1 - refactor a stateful component to use the store
* Task 2 - add a new reducer/action to the store and a new component that connects and uses it

### Hints on Grading and Assistance

* The lab is designed to get them touching state and manipulating it for various uses in a few ways.
* This is less about "getting it to work" and more about "understanding how" it works
* The takeway from their time in lab needs to be gaining an understanding on the wiring of a Redux application.
* Have the students draw diagrams of the code example in the README and of all of their starter/solution code.
* For grading purposes, tests are not required today, but a good UML diagram is.
