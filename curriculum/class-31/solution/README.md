# SOLUTION - Application State

## Lab Requirements

#### Grading Standards & Notes
  * Features
  * Code Quality
    * Wiring needs to be solid
  * Testing
    * Not required.  It's a stretch goal, though.
  * Deployment
    * Code Sandbox Only
  * Documentation
    * README Standards
    * Good UML is essential
    

## Lab Prep
Students will be working with 2 bits of starter code. In both cases, the store is provided.

* Task 1 - refactor a stateful component to use the store
* Task 2 - add a new reducer/action to the store and a new component that connects and uses it

### Hints on Grading and Assistance

* The lab is designed to get them touching state and manipulating it for various uses in a few ways.
* This is less about "getting it to work" and more about "understanding how" it works
* The takeway from their time in lab needs to be gaining an understanding on the wiring of a Redux application.
* Have the students draw diagrams of the code example in the README and of all of their starter/solution code.
* For grading purposes, tests are not required today, but a good UML diagram is.
