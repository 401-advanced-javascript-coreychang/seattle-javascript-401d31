===============================================================



[Demo App State/Redux](https://codesandbox.io/s/pkv39l16pj)

* Build out a full Redux implementation of a simple component that swaps out a name for a random number and then lets you reset it.  It uses a very simple action and reducer, but demonstrates the right ways to hook a component into a store.
* Following the main demo in the App component, create a new component (`<Name />`) and connect it to the store as well, but only to read state. This is cool to show students how 2 sibling components can connect to a common bit of global state and both respond to changes.

## Draw Pictures!

Students will really benefit from you creating a visual representation of the store and how components connect to it before you build out the code.
