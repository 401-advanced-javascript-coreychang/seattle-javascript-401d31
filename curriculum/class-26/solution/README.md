===================================================================

[Lab Solution](https://codesandbox.io/s/9894jnq4vr)

## Lab Prep
* The part of the lab assignment is to draw a process diagram of the starter code and state as events happen. Once the students understand that, they can move on.
* The "Work" part of lab is all about tinkering with the starter code. They will be converting to and between functional and class based components, putting them into different files, doing different things with state, etc. There's a lot of checkpoints along the way, but their final submission should resemble the solution code.
* Make sure and go through all the steps yourself so that you know the steps. Don't jump immediately to the solution, or you'll not be able to assist students as they plod through the practice exercises.
* Once all of the coding exercises are complete, the students should re-draw the process diagram to assert any changes based on how they broke things up and to ensure that state is being managed the same way.
