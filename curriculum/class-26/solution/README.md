# SOLUTION - Component Based UI

## Lab Requirements

### Lab Assignment 1
Students will be creating and styling a Counter application using starter code. Much of the base wiring is done for them, so that they can focus on the React coding bits, and not the configuration or wiring.

* Move the `Header` and `Footer` components to separate files
* Properly `export` them as defaults
* Import them into the `App` Component using ES6 `import` statement
* Convert the `Header` component to an ES6 Class
* Rename the `Main` component to `Counter` and render it properly
* Change the state declaration to track a `counter` instead of `stuff`
* Change the button handler to increment the counter instead of returning a random number.
* Add a second button that, when clicked, would decrement the counter
* Convert the buttons to links


#### Grading Standards & Notes
  * Features
    * As noted
  * Code Quality
    * Looking for proper class syntax
    * Good file naming and folder structure
    * Styles well written, using SASS variables/nesting and thought through beyond simple colors
  * Testing
    * Not Required
  * Deployment
    * Code Sandbox only.
  * Documentation
    * Quality README

#### Lab Assistance Notes
* The first and most important part of the lab assignment is to draw a process diagram of the starter code and state as events happen. Once the students understand that, they can move on.
* The "Work" part of lab is all about tinkering with the starter code. They will be converting to and between functional and class based components, putting them into different files, doing different things with state, etc. There's a lot of checkpoints along the way, but their final submission should resemble the solution code.
* Make sure and go through all the steps yourself so that you know the steps. Don't jump immediately to the solution, or you'll not be able to assist students as they plod through the practice exercises.
* Once all of the coding exercises are complete, the students should re-draw the process diagram to assert any changes based on how they broke things up and to ensure that state is being managed the same way.
