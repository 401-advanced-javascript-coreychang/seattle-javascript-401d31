================================================================


## Deployed Demos
* [Vanilla](https://codesandbox.io/s/14z4ox2mkq)
* [jQuery and Handlebars](https://codesandbox.io/s/ojr7z059j5)
* [React](https://codesandbox.io/s/n714rxljwm)


## Demo Notes
These are FUN. It's great to have the students revisit what they did in 201 and 301 with Vanilla JS and jQuery.

In fact, you might want to pair program with a student or a TA for the first 2 demos. At the least, have the class navigate while you drive. The demo here is all about a simple counter and a form field that puts its content into another tag. Pretty simple stuff, but surprizingly disconnected and tactial with both Vanilla and jQuery. Definitely shows the power of React

Highlight the fact that in react you never deal with the DOM directlry or call any render methods. Your markup simply "reacts" to changes in state. This is a pretty magical revelation for the students.


## Live Coding Demo(s)
We'll be starting the day with creating the same application in 3 ways.
* Render the current state of the "counter" and "words"
* When a user changes an input field, update words and re-render
* On a button click, update the counter and re-render

### Vanilla JS -- `demo-vanilla`
* Do the above in vanilla JS with event listeners

### jQuery and Handlebars -- `demo-jquery-hb`
* Swap out the vanilla event listeners for jQuery equivalents
* Bring in handlebars to do a better job of rendering

### React -- `demo-react`
* Write it in react, with a combination of functional and class components
* Talk through (briefly) setState and magical re-rendering
