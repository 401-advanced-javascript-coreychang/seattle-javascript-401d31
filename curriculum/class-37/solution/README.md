# SOLUTION -  `<Login />` and `<Auth />`

## Lab Requirements

* Students will be tasked with using the Auth/Login system
* They are provided a usable version of these component/context in the lab
* Their task will be to integrate that into a "CRUD" application and restrict access based on permissions (the To Do Application)
* The goal for this lab is not to implement Login/Auth, but to understand it at it's core purpose, and to seemlessly implement this as a means to solve a real world problem set.
