======================================================

## [Soulution for Auth/Login](https://codesandbox.io/s/qqzwkyx2n9)


**The students need a working and complete CMS (Class 35 Project) to complete this assignment**

## Lab Prep
* Students will be tasked with using the Auth/Login system
* They are provided a usable version of these component/context in the lab
* Their task will be to integrate that into a "CRUD" application and restrict access based on permissions (their CMS)
* The goal for this lab is not to implement Login/Auth, but to understand it at it's core purpose, and to seemlessly implement this as a means to solve a real world problem set.
