# DESIGN - HTML Tables

## Assignment
HTML tables are commonly used for displaying tabular data. They are challenging to design well as users tend to have a hard time focusing in large grids.

### Setup
If you haven't already done so, Fork the [starter sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/nrozq68z80) and connect it to your github account, creating a new repository called `design`, where you will be working on your design as you build it throughout the course of each daily design exercise.

Work in a new branch of this repo

### Requirements
* Work in a fork of your "sass-design" repository in your github account
* Create a new component in the design application called `<StandardTable />`
* Create a JSON file of data in a format that you define
* Require this data in your component, and use it to create your `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, `<tfoot>` markup
* Tinker with dynamism: adding rows dynamically, filtering, etc.
* Style the table in your design
* Provide SASS Classes or Mixins to handle some of the following concepts
  * Scrolling the body (to save visible vertical space)
  * Zebra striping either the rows or the columns
  * Better header/footer differentiation
  * Hover states and zooming
  * Printing
  * Column, Row, Cell spacing, separation, gridlines
