# DESIGN - Mobile / Media Queries

## Assignment
Lets get mobile. Most of what we've worked on with our designs to this point should already be mobile friendly, as the elements we've been working all stack by default.

Looking ahead, there will definitely be a need for differentiation and approach for laying out some application features differently for Mobile and Desktop.

This assignment will be to **wire in an approach** to identifying rules for different devices/widths.

### Setup
If you haven't already done so, Fork the [starter sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/nrozq68z80) and connect it to your github account, creating a new repository called `design`, where you will be working on your design as you build it throughout the course of each daily design exercise.

Work in a new branch of this repo

### Requirements

* Create a series of mixins, rules, or structures to support mobile/varying screen sizes, capabilities and breakpoints.
* You do not yet need to style anything in specific for mobile
* ... However, it's good idea to test your wiring with some proof-of-life (i.e. background color changes) to ensure that your approach is both universal, and will scale as your designs get more complicated.

The goal? Have a simple, well documented means of identifying desktop or mobile specific rules to any of your SASS modules, mixins, or element styles.

### Submission Instructions
Report in canvas with a link to the PR for this branch and/or a link to your sandbox running this new feature along with all preceding design work.  You may merge it to master after your submission is turned in.
