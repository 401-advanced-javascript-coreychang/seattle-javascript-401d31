# DESIGN - Form Fields: Advanced Inputs

## Assignment
Level up your form fields by applying custom style to radios, checkboxes, selects and HTML5 form field types. Traditionally, these are incredibly hard to style, because the browsers typically use the operating system's base apis to draw these, which negates your ability to apply CSS.

Luckily, there are some tricks you can use to circumvent these limitations ... but it might require some altered markup and some extra creativity.

**Inspiration**

* [checkboxes and radios](https://kyusuf.com/post/completely-css-custom-checkbox-radio-buttons-and-select-boxes)
* [states](https://alligator.io/css/styling-form-input-validity/)

### Setup
If you haven't already done so, Fork the [starter sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/nrozq68z80) and connect it to your github account, creating a new repository called `design`, where you will be working on your design as you build it throughout the course of each daily design exercise.

Work in a new branch of this repo

### Requirements
* Apply custom styling (completely overriding browser defaults) for:
  * `<select />`
  * `<input type="radio" />`
  * `<input type="checkbox" />`
  * `<input type="range" />`
  * `<input type="number" />`
  

### Submission Instructions
Report in canvas with a link to the PR for this branch and/or a link to your sandbox running this new feature along with all preceding design work.  You may merge it to master after your submission is turned in.
