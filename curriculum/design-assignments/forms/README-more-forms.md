# DESIGN - Forms: Field Styling

## Assignment
Style core form field elements for both visual appeal and usability

**Inspiration**
* [Free Front Ends](https://freefrontend.com/css-forms/)
* [Sanwebe](https://www.sanwebe.com/2014/08/css-html-forms-designs)

### Setup
If you haven't already done so, Fork the [starter sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/nrozq68z80) and connect it to your github account, creating a new repository called `design`, where you will be working on your design as you build it throughout the course of each daily design exercise.

Work in a new branch of this repo

### Requirements
* Create a new partial in your `core` folder called `_forms.scss` if you have not already done so.
* Apply styling for standard `<input />` and `<select />` and `<textarea />` fields including radios and checkboxes
* Take into account:
  * Accessibility
  * Placeholder text placement
  * Label placement
  * Animations and Transitions
  * States (focus, hover, change, etc)

### Submission Instructions
Report in canvas with a link to the PR for this branch and/or a link to your sandbox running this new feature along with all preceding design work.  You may merge it to master after your submission is turned in.
