### Setup
If you haven't already done so, Fork the [starter sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/nrozq68z80) and connect it to your github account, creating a new repository called `design`, where you will be working on your design as you build it throughout the course of each daily design exercise.

Work in a new branch of this repo

### Requirements
* Given an HTML form with standardized, semantic form markup, apply basic styles for optimal usability
  * `<form />`
  * `<fieldset /> <Legend />`
  * `<label />`
  * `<input />`
  * `Radio and Checkbox`
  * `<select />`
* Do not style the fields themselves. Focus on form layout for both top-down and ltr forms.
* Provide layout classes (i.e. 'horizontal', 'address') for extensibility

### Submission Instructions
Report in canvas with a link to the PR for this branch and/or a link to your sandbox running this new feature along with all preceding design work.  You may merge it to master after your submission is turned in.
