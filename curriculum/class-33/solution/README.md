# SOLUTION - Context and Hooks

#### Grading Standards & Notes
  * Features
    * A full counter, with modular parts that share the common context
  * Code Quality
    * Looking for consistent modularity
  * Testing
    * Test the deep mounting of context and it's availability
    * Functional tests required
  * Deployment
    * Travis and Code Sandbox
  * Documentation
    * README Standards
    * React Docs Required

#### Lab Assistance Notes
* The expectation here is that the students build out a fully tested counter application with context holding the state and the actions and providing them down.
* Students should be able to build this out pretty cleanly, with a good set of abstracted components. 
* Testing will be a hurdle, but a deep mount from the app level should allow them to perform what is essentially and end-to-end functional test.
