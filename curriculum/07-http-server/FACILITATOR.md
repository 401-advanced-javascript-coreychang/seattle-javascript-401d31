# Class 07

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about HTTP servers.  You should have a good handle on how to implement/use the native NodeJS `http` module.  The lecture/lab portion of this day is highly experimental and will require lots of experimentation with the creation of a server, basic `req` methods, and how to capture and modify components of the `request` and `response`.

## What changed from yesterday? 
Today is all HTTP!  No more TCP!

## What might students struggle with today?
Students will struggle with having a good grasp on the conceptual understanding of the web request response cycle.  They may have had prior experience with this in 301 but a recap of this process is highly beneficial.  Let students know that a deep understanding of this process is vital to the creation of a modern RESTful API.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Students have had issues with swapping the `req` and `res` objects in their routes and/or in their route logic, causing incorrect data to be returned when calling the API.  You'll want to keep an eye out for this.
