## Preparation
* Get teh API and Q servers up and running (the versions in the apps-and-libraries folders are the latest) locally and in heroku
* Test them against the solution code so that you're confident in how this all operates before you start demo'ing it


## Lab Prep
* Demonstrate the working solution code to show the baseline expectations for this. (This uses previously deployed servers)
* Ensure that the students know the full scope of the lab
* They'll need to:
   * Deploy a working and properly configured Q server to Heroku and note it's URL
   * Deploy a working API server to Heroku that publishes events on the models to that Q server
   * Create a React app that also connects to the Q server
* There's not a lot of coding to do on those servers, but they'll need to refresh their memory a bit to get them deployed and working together.
  * Push them to getting this to work!
