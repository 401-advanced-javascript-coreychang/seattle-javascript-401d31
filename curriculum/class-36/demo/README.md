![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) DEMOS - Context and Hooks
===============================================================

## [Context API](https://codesandbox.io/s/v054jk7jj0)

For this demo, the actual code being written is relatively small, but the concept is again pretty large.

Definitely spend plenty of time in pictures, drawing out the connections between the context provider and the components before you code it out. This should give you a good reference point to refer to as you write out the code.

The demo only needs a simple context provider with one bit of state and one modifier method. That will be enough to sell the concept and give the students the tools to build out their counter application.
