==================================================================

[Context Solution](https://codesandbox.io/s/1rp021q45q)

The expectation here is that the students build out a fully tested counter application with context holding the state and the actions and providing them down.

Students should be able to build this out pretty cleanly, with a good set of abstracted components. 

Testing will be a hurdle, but a deep mount from the app level should allow them to perform what is essentially and end-to-end functional test.
