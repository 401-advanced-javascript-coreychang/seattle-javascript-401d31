# Facilitators Guide: Hooks API

## Preparation
In this session, we'll be introducing yet another way to manage state in React -- Hooks

Definitely go through the readings and videos before you dive in, as there are a few ways to implement hooks.

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow
* What are Hooks?
  * A means of managing state in Function Components
  * "Hooks are functions that let you 'hook into' React state and lifecycle features from function components."
  * Generally export a "getter" and a "setter"
  * Built-In hooks exist for specific cases
    * `useState()` to manage single bits of state
    * `useReducer()` to mimic the reducer pattern
    * `useContext()` to gain access to the Context API
    * `useEffect()` - to perform side effects on a function component (lifecycle hooks)
      * Effects are scheduled (and re-set) to run after every render
