# LAB - React Native

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started*  in [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

**Visualize the Application**

Evaluate the lab requirements and begin with drawing a **UML** and/or **Data/Process Flow diagram**.  Having a solid visual understanding of the code you have/need and how it connects is critical to properly approaching this assignment.

**Break Down the Assignment**

Once you have a good visual and mental model of how the application works, break down the requirements and assess how to apply each requirement to your model.

 * For Each Requirement, ask yourself questions such as:
   * Where should this new code live in the codebase?
   * Which existing code needs to be modified?
   * Are there any dependencies that this feature requires

**Map your priorities and dependencies before jumping into the code.**

## Getting Started
* Install XCode (Mac Users)
* Install Android Studio (All Users)
    * Install 1 device emulator
* Install expo-cli
* Create an account at expo.io
* Create a login for snack.expo.io
* Create google play and apple developer accounts

## Assignment
Create your first Phone App. What it does and how it looks is up to you. This is an opportunity to play around with whats possible in React Native and to get a feel for how you can get into the various device features.

This is a 2-day assignment, after which you will live-demo your phone app to the class (at the start of class 43)

**Day 1** - Focus on getting your dev system up and operational and getting "proof of life"

**Day 2** - Add in the device features, polish, and prepare for deployments.


### Requirements
* Use 2 screens
* Use and share state between components/screens
* Use at least 1 native device feature (contacts, camera, gps, etc)

###  Documentation
Complete the README.md file included in the lab folder

### Submission
* Submit a link to your PR
* If you developed on Snack, include your snack link in your README so that we can easily open and run your app on our devices
