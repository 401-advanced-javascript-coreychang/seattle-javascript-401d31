The first React Native class is designed to introduce students into the React Native Ecosystem. 

* Spinning up a dev environment
* Expo
* Running Emulators
* Getting Deployed
* Other frameworks like Flutter
* Basic Coding Principles
    * RN Specific Components (`<View/>` and `<Text/>`)
    * Device features and capabilities

## Preparation
* Setup expo-cli on your machine and work with a basic hello world app that runs from your local.
* Familiarize yourself with the [http://expo.io] online IDE and how they work similarly
* Have a good grasp of the Expo and React Native docs
  * What can you do on your phone?
  * How does security work?
* Build a full app and explain what goes inside

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow
* React Native Ecosystem
  * What is native development?
  * Why is it important to develop a native app vs a responsive react app?
  * It's still just state and components
    * But no HTML or CSS
    * You can still "style" things, but within the rules
* Expo Is the dev environment
* Snack is an online sandbox
* expo-cli is the local equivalent to create-react-app (you can eject)
* Running locally, you can use your own device or the official simulator
  * Only Apple users can test iphones 
  * Anyone can test android, but you need to start up the ADB from Android Studio
