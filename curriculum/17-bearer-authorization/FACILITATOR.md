# Class 17

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about token based authorization for accessing specific routes of their application.  Be sure to understand the differences between "basic" and "bearer" authorization and their use cases within a modern API.

## What changed from yesterday? 
Students have already created a basic authentication module for "sign up" and "sign in".  Today, they'll be creating a token based "bearer" authorization module for accessing routes of their application.  Be sure to detail how this module will be used as a piece of middleware within their routes.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will likely struggle with the understanding of how JSON web tokens work, along with how we are using custom methods on our User model for token creation.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Lot's of random issues with getting authorized into their application and routes!  Be sure to place an emphasis on writing good and meaninful tests to help determine where these issues arise.  Having great hooks in your test file for test data creation and database cleanup are a good idea to emphasise too!
