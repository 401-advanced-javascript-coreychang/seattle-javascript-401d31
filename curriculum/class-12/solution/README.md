# Solution: OAuth

The solution code for this lab is effectively the same as the lab starter code (and the lecture demo) with a few notable exceptions:

* In the `auth/oauth/` folder, there are multiple provider implementations to use to grade student submissions with.
* There's also an index file that can be used to use different providers based on configuration/environment settings.  Good teaching moment there during code review.


#### Grading Standards & Notes
* The code written for this assignment, while important, is less-so than the verbal presentation.
  * The actual lab is time-boxed to 4 hours, so completion rates are typically low.
* Student groups must present a clear "GO/No-Go" argument and full readiness assessment for their assigned provider.
* Grade should be based on that presentation, conclusions, and ability to handle a Q&A session.

  * Features
    * End to End OAuth Login with the assigned provider
    * High Quality presentation
      * Code Samples
      * Solidly backed-up pros and cons
  * Code Quality
