# Class 01

## How do I prep for today?
Skim through past course demo to prep for explaining commonJS modules. Review the orientation slide deck.

##### Brian - d22:
* for this day, it's important to be really comfortable creating basic NodeJS modules, methods on those modules, and the ability to work with basic testing constructs
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
N/A

##### Brian - d22:
* nothing - it's day 1!

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with the command line and testing. Some students will have trouble setting up NVM.

##### Brian - d22:
* students are going to likely have trouble getting used to the syntax of creating basic, but meaningful, tests.  Be sure to emphasize all components of creating a series of tests for a specific module - I often start this process by diagramming a standard test flow on the whiteboard.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Some students will need help setting up slack and canvas. Students also will not follow lab instructions correctly. Students will need help finding the you tube channel.

##### Brian - d22:
* some students will not have NodeJS or `nvm` properly installed - be ready to combat this during the first few hours of lab - sometimes the best approach is to uninstall their current versions and do a fresh reinstall

## General comments
Start the day with ice breakers to learn student names, and introduce your self.

##### Brian - d22:
* to second the above comment - introductions - be sure to introduce yourself, the TAs, and have each student introduce themselves and their "why" behind taking 401JS
