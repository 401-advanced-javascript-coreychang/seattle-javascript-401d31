# Class 01

## How do I prep for today?
It's day 1!  Having a good handle on how much time you'll need to discuss each topic, and the way that you'll transition into subsequent topics, is a key factor of getting consistency and efficency into your daily lecture format.  Be sure to follow the same general flow throughout the course and feel free to create a checklist (in GitHub or on the whiteboard) to outline the content of the day.

You'll want to have a solid level of comfort with the NodeJS `module.exports` pattern, how to export a single function vs multiple methods on a custom module, and how to test a custom module and the methods you've added to it. The only third party `npm` package you'll be working with on this day is `jest` - let students know that you'll start talking about the `npm` ecosystem, `package.json`, `npm` scripts, etc the following lecture.
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
N/A - it's the first day!

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with getting acclimated to the course assignment workflow and basic computer setup (from the 401 prework).  Some students will not have Slack, NodeJS, NVM, or Homebrew (for MacOS) properly installed - be prepared to address these issues first thing in lab. Some students (primarily those that have tested into 401) may need assitance with Canvas configuration and setup.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Many students will not follow the lab instructions correctly. You'll want your TA's to do regular check-in's during the first couple of hours of lab to make sure everyone is on the right track. Students may also have a hard time finding daily course resources, like the YouTube playlist and course repository - be sure to put those links in Slack and pin them so that students will always be able to access them quickly.

## General comments
Start the day off with instructor/student/TA introductions and, depending on the size of the class, take the time to personalize each student's "who am i and why am i here" comments with your own tie-in's back to the course content and/or future job opportunities.
