# Class 19

## How do I prep for today?
Time to deploy!  You'll need to have a solid understanding of the Heroku platform for enviornment, pipeline, and application creation, along with the use of TravisCI for continuous integration.  Create a few test apps, deploy them, and make sure you have that process down cold :).

## What changed from yesterday? 
Today, we add support for TravisCI and prepare their applications for deployment.  You'll be adding a `.travis.yml` file, a `.coveralls.yml` file (if you choose to use this for code coverage), and configuring TravisCI and Heroku to have to proper environment variables to build their apps.  Review the `package.json`, `.travis.yml`, and `.coveralls.yml` files in the demos for today to gain a better idea of how to configure.  TravisCI and Heroku constantly evolve, so you may need to modify these files to work with the constraints/dependencies of the application you've been building.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will get lots of "application error" pages showing up when deploying their applications.  Be sure to have them watch the build logs in Heroku for more info.  Generally, let students know that configuring and prepping your application for deployment can be time consuming and, at times, frustrating.  Taking the time to step through each part of the process slowly should help with this.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Apps may not get deployed correctly and/or TravisCI may constantly fail their tests or not run as expected!  Be ready to address these issues in lab!

## General comments
Students will also be presenting/selecting mid-quarter project ideas today!  Be sure to have a good process of project selection in mind and reach out to other instructors for their insight, if needed!
