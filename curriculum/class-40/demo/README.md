# Demos: Block 8 - DS&A, Designs, Comp Sci, Recap

### SASS: Cards and Decks

Show the included sample, which showcases a few Card and Deck designs. Don't go too deep into the code, but rather how this renders out a recognizable web page.  Students should be led into recognizing visual patterns and be encouraged to strategize on their own.

Do, however, share card and deck markup, so that they can start to mentally map what they're seeing with how the CSS might look.

Demo here should be less about the CSS code itself but rather in how cards and decks actually work, so that they can replicate that during the following days -- their lab is going to be to implement their own custom grid system, using this as inspiration.

It has been helpful in the past to talk about, with drawings, how these can work and then pair program part of the implementation with either a TA or a student, getting input from the class

Generally speaking, the SASS demos are great when interactively, as most students have a decent understanding of CSS and are much more willing to contribute ideas.


### Project / Lab Prep

Students will be creating a complete version of the [RESTy](https://resty.netlify.com) application by refactoring a simplistic working version.

* Do not do a code review of their starter code.
* It's important for this lab that they're able to jump into existing code and "figure it out", especially when given a visually working application to build from.
* Ensure that you have a running API server
* Recommend that the students use their own
* They should be able to run their RESTy against any API
