# Class 16

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about basic authentication and how we use this type of authentication for "sign up" and "sign in".  Having a solid grasp on `Authorization` headers is vital to the presentation of this content.  You'll also want to review the User model of the demos from previous courses.  These demo's should showcase the inclusion of methods on your data models, for added functionality, such as hashing of a password and the decryption of a hashed password.  Students will be working with token based authorization on the following day and getting a good foundation today will surely help with their understanding of this.

## What changed from yesterday? 
It's a new week and time to get their applications to the next level!  As students are getting ramped up for the week, it may be a good idea to set expectations for the progression of the week and the content that is to come.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students may struggle with getting their authentication middleware to work properly.  Keep an eye on the areas where they use string manipulation, and look out for basic syntax errors and bugs.  Outside of that, if your students have a good grasp on JS fundamentals, this day shouldn't be as intense as they may have expected.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Issues with basic syntax errors are the most common during this day.  Be sure to push students to use the NodeJS debugger and `debug` to provide them with a stack trace to efficiently debug their errors.
