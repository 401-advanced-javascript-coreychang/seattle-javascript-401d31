# Facilitators Guide: Block 3 - DS&A, Designs, Comp Sci, Recap

At the end of this Block the students are presented with 3 assignments:

* End of Block "Project": Authenticated API Server
  * 25 Points
  * Paired
  * Due prior to the start of the next Block
* Design Challenge
  * 10 Points
  * Due prior to the end of the next Block
* Data Structure Implementation: Trees
  * 10 Points
  * Due prior to the start of the next class
    * Will be used in subsequent code challenges
    
## Preparation
* Ensure that you have a solid API Server and a solid Auth Server that you can demo from
* Get ready with a solid Tree Demo and Implementation


## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

### DS&A - Trees: Binary and BST

* Lots of great drawings today!
* First, we introduce trees as a basic structure
* Talk about the different ways to traverse a tree
  * Breadth First: Queue
    * Draw a queue and visually traverse, showing how the queue is built and used during the process
  * Depth First
    * First visual needs to be the types of traversals
    * Have the students predict the values as you traverse each way
    * First chance to talk about recursion
    * DEMO
* Introduce BSTs
  * Just a Binary tree, but with rules
  * Rules allow you to easily add and search
  * Provides clarity to your traversals
  
### SASS - Forms and UI
* The readings for this class covered not only form field designs, but a couple of videos on usability, which is a huge issue for web forms.
* Lecture today should focus on the usability piece -- 
  * what does it mean to be successful in filling out a form?
  * How can we use layout to ensure success?
  * How does accessibility play in?
  * How can we use labels, placeholders and defaults?
  * Tab controls?

### Lab/Project Prep
* Demo both the API and Auth Servers
* Review the requirements with the class
* Documentation: JSDoc, Swagger, README
* Full Test Coverage (and run through Travis)
* Dynamic Models
  * Ship with 2 connected models
* Common API Route
* Authenticated Access Control to API operations
* Make Auth "optional" through an ENV setting
* Deployable (Heroku)
* Proper error and 404 handling middleware
* Fully checked and validated inputs (type checking, valididy)
* Static Route Handler

Group the students and have them work through a whiteboard session before starting
