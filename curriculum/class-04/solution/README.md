# Solution: Data Modeling

## Lab Requirements

This is a big lab, both conceptually and in code. The students will (and should) take 2 passes at this.

The notion of a "Parent Class" will have been stressed in class, and is given as starter code, but getting their heads wrapped around this idea in practice will be a big ask.

Grade them accordingly, treating the persistence version as the icing, not the whole cake. They'll get to see that in code review and can take a second run at it.
