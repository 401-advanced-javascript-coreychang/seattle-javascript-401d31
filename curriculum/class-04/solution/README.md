=============================================================

## Code Generator

Students must feed a string of code into a "generator", which will create an empty buffer and fill it, character by character, from that string, returning a full buffer which they can then write to a file.

* Push them towards creating a class to do the work, and a function that then calls the class with some code block (see create-code.js)


## HTML Creator
* The concept here is going to be for them to recognize patterns in the text file. 
  * How do I tell what a paragraph is? 
  * Where do I put my open and closing brackets?
  * How can I repeat those repetitive steps?
  
The big thing for both of these will be in figuring out how to test it. Suggest to the students that they start simple in their tests and create a buffer from a string as their starting and ending points. Then, their code can accept that string and produce a buffer that exactly matches the one in their test.
