# Facilitators Guide: Javascript and Web Frameworks

This is the first of a 2-day grouped research and development project, designed to have the students teach themselves an entirely new framework, and then prepare a knowledge transfer of their learnings to the group.

Lecture is split over the last 2 days of the course. In the first lecture, you'll introduce the concept and demo the process.  In the second lecture, you'll be doing a sample presentation (as you expect to see from them) as well as to demonstrate the installation and operation of a Wordpress site.

## Preparation
* Dust off anything from your past and prep a counter demo application.
* If you've previously used PHP, Perl, Ember, Backbone or any other framework in your previous experience, lean into that knowledge.
* If not, pick one (not angular or vue), learn it, and prepare a demo that makes use of it.
* The point of this lecture and lab is to give the students a good look at the process of diving into something completely different and foreign and still being able to execute.

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

* Recap what we know, by spinning up a basic counter application in our familiar frameworks. This is a repeat of class 26 (but you can do this in 15 minutes instead of 2 hours!)
  * Vanilla JS
  * jQuery
  * React
* Once you've recapped it, talk about a process to follow if you **didn't** know what you were doing.
  * What's the framework?
  * Who else uses it?
  * Where are the docs?
  * Are there any youtube how-tos? Online tutorials?
  * Is there a demo or starter kit that you can download?
  * Is there a walk-through?
  * Is there an online community/reddit?

## Lab Prep
**This is a 2-Session (Day), TEAM assignemnt. Make groups of 2-4 students and assign each group one framework from todomv.com** Teams will present on Day 45, leading into final project prep

* Students will have to dive really deep into things they will not understand
* Its important that they understand the goals of this project
  * Report back with a demo, documentation, and direction as though they are kicking off a project for a new team go live on.
  * The README is critical. It needs to contain information to help a new team get going, tips & tricks, links, demo code, etc.
* They must have working demo code, a full set of docs, and will be required to do a 10-15 minute presentation to the rest of the class.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
* Depending on the framework you give each group, this could be a bear. Try to give them as little tactical advice as you can, only directional. This is a critical assignment for them to really learn how to learn and learn how to transfer knowledge.

## General Comments and Notes
* Have fun. This is a great way to end the course. This is the ultimate "what did you learn about learning?" exercise!
