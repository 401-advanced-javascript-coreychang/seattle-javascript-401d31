# Class 27

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about detailing `state` and `props` within React.  State management is a huge topic so be sure to have a good understanding of their differences.  Here's a basic rundown:

**State:**
- can get it's initial value from a parent component
- cannot be changed by a parent component
- can set default values inside a component
- can change inside a component
- can set initial values for child components
- cannot change in child components

**Props:**
- can get it's initial value from a parent component
- can be changed by a parent component
- can set default values inside the component
- cannot change inside the component
- can set initial values for child components
- can change in child components

You'll also be detailing the creation and use of a form within React.  Be sure to spend time discussing the basics of how forms work and how we can create modular form components that work for multiple use cases.

## What changed from yesterday? 
Today, we begin to work with forms.  You'll still be using the same `webpack.config.js` file but be sure to rebuild it with students in order to further their understanding of it.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Student will struggle in lab.  They'll have a hard time managing `state` and `props`, along with generally dealing with basic syntax errors since they've just been introduced to a new framework.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Lot's of Webpack compiling issues and lot's of state management confusion.  Spend the time that you need to spend of these topics - it's worth it in the longrun!
