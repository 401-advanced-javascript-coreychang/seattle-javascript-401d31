# Class 27

## How do I prep for today?
Today is about the proper handling and utilization of `state` and `props` within ReactJS.  State management is a major part of most modern frontend applications and students will often struggle with the differences/uses of `state` vs `props`.  Here's a basic rundown:

**State:**
- can get it's initial value from a parent component
- cannot be changed by a parent component
- can set default values inside a component
- can change inside a component
- can set initial values for child components
- cannot change in child components

**Props:**
- can get it's initial value from a parent component
- can be changed by a parent component
- can set default values inside the component
- cannot change inside the component
- can set initial values for child components
- can change in child components

As you demo and discuss these concepts, also focus on the usage of `<form>`'s within ReactJS. Spend time revewing the basics of vanilla HTML `<form>`'s and how they work.  This will set them up for seeing the advantages of creating modular `<form>` components, for multiple use cases, in a component framework, like ReactJS.

## What changed from yesterday? 
Today, we begin to work with `<form>`'s.  You may still use the same `webpack.config.js` file from previous demos but be sure to rebuild it with students in order to further their understanding of it.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle in lab.  Have your TAs ready to assist!

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Webpack compiling issues are common and `state` managament issues will continue to persist.  Spend the time recapping these topics - it's worth it in the longrun!
