# Class 28

## How do I prep for today?
Today is the first day that students will be modularizing their components into separate files and working with a frontend router to handle the different "pages" of their application.  Be sure to have a good understanding of how to pass around `props` and how to "lift" the application state so that they achieve a 1-way data flow.  There's alot to cover on this day, if you've got time, moving into component testing is a great idea.  If not, this can be pushed to the following day.

## What changed from yesterday?
Today, students will be working with parent/child components and getting exposure to component testing (granted time permits).  Spend some time talking about how the application state is "lifted" on the change/submission of certain components/forms.  Diagramming this process on the whiteboard is also a really good idea.

## What might students struggle with today?
Students will struggle with understanding how to handle the state of their application, along with how to lift the state and properly use the `setState` method.  As noted above, spend the time you need to spend on covering state management - it's worth it both for you and the students.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Lot's of bugs and issues related to state management!  Have your TAs ready to review `props` and `state` with students, as needed, during lab!
