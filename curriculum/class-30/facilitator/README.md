# Facilitators Guide: DS&A, Designs, Comp Sci, Recap


At the end of this Block the students are presented with 3 assignments:

* End of Block "Project": RESTy
  * 25 Points
  * Paired
  * Due prior to the start of the next Block
* Design Challenge
  * 10 Points
  * Due prior to the end of the next Block
* Data Structure Implementation: Hash Tables
  * 10 Points
  * Due prior to the start of the next class
    * Will be used in subsequent code challenges
    

## Preparation
* Get your AWS and Azure accounts opened
* Practice a few deployments

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

### DS&A - Hash Tables

* "Dictionary" 
* Resembles a standard JS Object Literal with keys and "true" values
* JS has a built-in `map()` structure that we can use
* Today, we learn the classic Computer Science implementation, even though most languages have this natively.
* O(1) Lookups for keys
* O(n) Lookups for values
* Create a table of n size
* Hash the "key" down to a number that corresponds to a node in the hash table
* Store the values in a linked list 
* Often, this DS is used as a helper, to provide O(1) lookups and history.

### SASS - Hidden Content

* Drawers, Modals, Accordions
* Review techniques for hiding/showing/animations
* There are accessibility issues with hidden content, as screen readers will not present the content.
* Must provide an alternative
* Mobile also presents an issue, depending on how you trigger the show/hide

For demo, review the starter code (in the design-assignments folder) and look at the table markup for both normal and responsive tables

### Lab Prep

* Demo the currently [deployed RESTy app](https://resty.netlify.com)
* Whiteboard and plan out how to approach the architecture.
