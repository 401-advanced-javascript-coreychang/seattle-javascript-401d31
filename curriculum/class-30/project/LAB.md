# Block 5 Project: City Explorer

## Description
We currently have a live City Explorer application running on 2 servers. The front end application is currently hosted at Github Pages

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started* in [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for complete setup instructions

## Requirements
* Re-Implement the City Explorer Front-End using React
* With the exception the landing page, match the design and behavior of the [current application](https://codefellows.github.io/city_explorer/)
* Bypass the home page. Rather than ask for an API URL, use the deployed API, located here:
    * https://city-explorer-backend.herokuapp.com
* Accept an input for city, state
* Fetch the location from the API
* Call the API for each service to retrieve the correct data
* Render into each column, the properly formatted results of each service call

## Assignment Submission Instructions
Refer to the [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for the complete lab submission process and expectations

* Create a city-explorer repo at github
* Initialize your repo and app by running create-react-app
* Run a local build of your application when complete
* Deploy your /build folder to AWS S3
