# Demos: Block 5 - DS&A, Designs, Comp Sci, Recap 

### Hash Tables

[Common Curriculum Hash Map Demo](https://github.com/codefellows/common_curriculum/tree/master/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-30/demos/javascript)

* Create a core hashmap class
* Code a simplistic hashing algorithm
  * Reinforce lecture notes on what makes a "good hash"
* Code out the `add()` method
* Pseudocode and Whiteboard `get()` and `has()`

### SASS: Hidden Content

* Demo a basic modal
  * CSS for centering, opacity, etc.
* Talk through some ideas for Drawers, Accordions, etc.

It has been helpful in the past to talk about, with drawings, how these can work and then pair program part of the implementation with either a TA or a student, getting input from the class

Generally speaking, the SASS demos are great when interactively, as most students have a decent understanding of CSS and are much more willing to contribute ideas.


### Project / Lab Prep

Students will be creating a partial version of the [RESTy](https://resty.netlify.com) application from scratch, using the tools they've gained in this first block.

* Review the proper use of the `fetch()` API for RESTful requests to API servers
* Encourage them to work in teams to diagram the application and create a preliminary UML/Flow diagram before they start
* Ensure that you have a running API server
* Recommend that the students use their own
* They should be able to run their RESTy against any API
