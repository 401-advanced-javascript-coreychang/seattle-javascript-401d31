# LAB: Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started* in [lab-instructions.md](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs.md) for complete setup instructions

## Getting Started
In the `objects` folder, there is a full implementation of a Car and Motorcycle object created using a constructor function, with an index.js file that you can use to visually play with the objects as well as tests.

In the `objects/__tests__` folder, you'll find a file called `vehicle.test.js` that tests the implementation of both a `Car` and a `Motorcycle` using the constructor pattern.
