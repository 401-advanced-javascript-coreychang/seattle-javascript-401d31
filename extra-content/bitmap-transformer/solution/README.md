# Solutions: Block 1 Project and DS&A

## DS&A - Linked Lists
[Solution Code](https://github.com/codefellows/common_curriculum/tree/master/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/solutions/javascript/)

#### Grading Standards & Notes

* Features
  * Node Constructor
  * Linked List Constructor
  * Insert and Append
* Code Quality
  * Uses a javascript Class
  * Properly exported
  * Promises!
* Testing
  * 80% coverage
* Deployment
  * Travis Only
* Documentation
  * README Standards
  * JSDoc Required
  * Documentation should be VERY clear about how to import and use the constructor
      

## Design - Scaffolding

#### Grading Standards & Notes
There is no "official" solution for the design challenges, as these are completely student driven in terms of style.  

From a grading standpoint, look for and assess the requirements:

* Proper Modularization of SASS Modules
* Usage of mixins, variables and partials
* Deployed site to view the rendered implementation
* Repo with an open PR for code comments

## Bitmap Transformer

### Lab Requirements
Perform 2+ Transformations on an 8-bit bitmap file

#### Grading Standards & Notes
* Features
  * 2 Transformations
  * Not "turn it blue" and "turn it red"
  * One basic color transform is cool
* Code Quality
  * Each transform should be in it's own module
  * Dynamically load/run the transform based on input
  * Parse the bitmap with a constructor or class
  * File ops should be separate, reusable modules
  * Promises!
* Testing
  * Test everything independently
  * Transforms should potentially work on any buffer
  * Mock out an 8-bit buffer that you can predicably test
* Deployment
  * Travis Only
* Documentation
  * README Standards
  * JSDoc Required
  * Documentation should be VERY clear about how to run the transformations in the terminal
    * Getting good habits for documenting terminal commands is important for students, so be strict about this
    * Enforcing clear documentation now will make or better documentation and easier grading later on

#### Lab Assistance Notes
* Don't hand hold them
* RTFM. RTFM. RTFM.
