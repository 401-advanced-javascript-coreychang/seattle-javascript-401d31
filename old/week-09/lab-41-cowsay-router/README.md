For this assignment you will be creating a routed cowsay app. You should have a series of possible routes that correspond to which "cow" will be saying the result of the 2-way binding. For instance www.myapp.com/#/cow1 will have
the default cow and have a 2-way data binding similar to your first angular cowsay assignment. The important part of this assignment is to not repeat yourself. Try to have as little repitition as possible to display each of the "cows".
