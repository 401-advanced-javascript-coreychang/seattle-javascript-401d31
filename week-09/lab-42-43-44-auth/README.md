# Explain Client Side Auth

By yourself or with a partner explain the client side auth that we wrote in class. There a series of comments inside of the javascript code in the 
TODO(instructors): replace this with your directory and use this one as a template:
https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d7/week_9/jun_1_client_auth_2_electric_boogaloo 

directory that begin with the string AUTH_EXP. Find all of these locations using the command `grep -r AUTH_EXP app` while in the jun_1 folder. There are short descriptions of what you need to explain, feel free to ask any clarifying questions in slack. There are 5 locations to explain, you'll get 2 points for each. Submit as pull request back to the class repository.

# Requirements
  * Find all the AUTH_EXP sections and describe what they are doing
