# Client Side Cowsay
Build a client-side cowsay application. See the command-line `cowsay` for inspiration.

This assignment should contain an express static server, a gulp file that can create a webpack bundle, an index that pulls in your bundle and uses 2-way data binding in an angular app to power the cow's speach bubble. 

Make sure to style your app using some css to control the layout (and the font, if you like). 

As a bonus make your app capable of changing the cow image to something else.
