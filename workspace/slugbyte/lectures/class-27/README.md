## Learning Objectives
* Students will learn to create forms in React 
* Students will learn to manage React's controlled inputs

## Readings
* [React Forms](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html)

## White Board Challenge

## Overview 
* 30min DSA
* 1hr code review
* 1.5hr React forms 

#### Code Demo
* React forms have an `onSubmit` prop that consumes an event handler
* Event handler functions must be bound to the component's constructor
* React inputs should be controlled using a components state
* Controlled inputs are configured by binding an inputs value to a property on the state, and createing an `onChange` handler that updates the state.
* `onChange` handlers are great places for user validation, or modifying the users input
