# Create a "Communication" Service That Holds/Resolves All Errors
For this assignment you'll be building on your error handling service. For this create a service that contains all of the errors generated by your application. There should be a way to resolve the errors and any controller/directive/other service should be able to inject and use this global error handler.

# Requirements
  * One service to contain all error messages.
  * A way to display the errors to the user.
  * Injectible to any part of your app (where it makes sense).
