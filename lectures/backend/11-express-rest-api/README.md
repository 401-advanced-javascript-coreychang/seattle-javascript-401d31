* students will be able to leverage 3rd party helper modules for debugging, logging, and handling errors

## Overview

## Express
ExpressJS is a lightweight framework for building web servers. ExpressJS extends the NodeJS http module with a minimal feature set that enables developers to build quickly build powerful web applications. Express features include routing with url params, error handling, a static server, cookie and link helpers, convienience methods for sending json and jsonp, locataion and redirect management, request parsing, server side redning, and a framework for creating middleware to extend express.
